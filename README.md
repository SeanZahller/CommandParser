# CSCD350GroupProject
Project for a war games simulator. 2 Parts: 
1) Creating a command parser for an already built large API. The command parser creates objects called from the API and gives them the correct parameters to run. Tested against large tester file with a visual representation. 
2) Airplane mover class from scratch. All functions to create and properly move an airplane. Creates an airplane that takes several parameters to determine how it travels. Tested against a very large hidden test file, 98% accuracy
